              Secondary power system in generators and in industries or
              commercial buildings are installed with process system
              distribution panel boards (PDBs), also known as low-tension
              switchgear systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Low tension distribution systems receive power at 415 V (3-phase)
              / 240 V (1-phase) from transformers and distribute it to various
              power and lighting loads through multiple feeders.
            </p>
            <p>
              The switchgear includes air circuit breakers, molded case circuit
              breakers, miniature circuit breakers, residual current devices,
              fuses, contactors, and protective relays for the safe distribution
              of electrical energy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Custom-built low-tension distribution panels are manufactured in
              both fixed type and draw-out type designs to suit customer
              requirements.
